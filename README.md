# titanic-data-eda
We performed data cleaning as part of the exploratory analysis on Titanic-Dataset.csv. Specifically, we handled missing values by filling in missing Age and Fare entries using the median values for those columns. Three columns with excessive missing data or high-cardinality (many unique values) — Cabin, Ticket, and Name — were removed entirely from the dataset to simplify future analysis. The resulting cleaned dataset retains all relevant features with imputed values and is saved as Titanic_Cleaned.csv, ready for machine learning and further statistical exploration.
